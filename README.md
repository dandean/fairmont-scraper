# Fairmont Scraper

This is a crappy little script which scrapes a hotel at Whistler for 60 days of prices.

I wrote this because our schedule is flexible and I just want the cheapest days. Unfortunately they can't tell me this over the phone, and I can deal with clicking through every single date manually.
